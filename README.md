# Swimming Contest app

During the spring semester of my second university year as a student, I worked on this client-server project that manages the swimming races of a swimming contest. 

### With the purpose of studying different technologies, I created several versions of the same app:
- Client and Server both written in Java
- Client and Server both written in C#
- Client in Java, Server in C#, communicating with each other using Protobuf messages
- Client in Java, Server in C#, communicating with each other using ActiveMQ messages

### I also created REST services
- There is a REST server written in Java
- There is a REST client written in Java
- There is a REST client written in C#
- there is a REST client written in ReactJS
